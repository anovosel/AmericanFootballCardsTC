TopCoder challenge

Challenge task:

It may be a little provincial of us but it is now football season in the United States.  Don't worry though you don't need to know much about football to work on this challenge.  

1) The first page of the application will list all NFL teams.  Here is a list of all NFL teams and their logos.

2) Once you have a list of all of the nfl teams, a user can click on any team.  Pulling up the team will list their next games and the logo for each competitor.  

3) You do not need to make it dynamic we can hard code all NFL and assume the start date is 10/11.  

4) You only need to support 4 teams, Patriots, Steelers, Cowboys, 49ers.
